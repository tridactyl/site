We're friendly. You can talk to us via [Matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#tridactyl:matrix.org), [`#tridactyl`](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#tridactyl) on [Libera](https://libera.chat/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/DWbNGTAvmh) and [gitter](https://gitter.im/tridactyl/Lobby).

If none of that suits you, filing [an issue](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/new) is a good way of getting our attention.

A couple of the developers can also be contacted via Keybase: [bovine3dom](https://keybase.io/bovine3dom) and [cmcaine](https://keybase.io/cmcaine), which is the preferred contact method for security issues.
